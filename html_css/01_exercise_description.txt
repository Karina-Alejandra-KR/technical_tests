1. Create a basic HTML structure:

Build a page with:

-A <header> header with a title.
-A navigation menu <nav> with three links (Home, Services, Contact).
-A main content <main> with an article and an additional section.
-A footer <footer> with contact information.

Include appropriate semantic tags.
